## üìÇ Lab Structure
Each lab contains:
- `README.md` - Scenario, objectives, and instructions
- `infrastructure/` - IaC templates (Terraform/CloudFormation/ARM)
- `applications/` - Sample application code
- `scripts/` - Automation and helper scripts
- `monitoring/` - Dashboards and alerts
- `cost-analysis/` - Cost tracking and optimization

## üöÄ Quick Start
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/devops-labs.git
cd devops-labs/05-cloud-native-labs

# Start with AWS Essentials
cd lab-01-aws-essentials
./scripts/setup.sh

# Follow the README for detailed instructions
cat README.md
```

## üìä Progress Tracking
- [ ] Lab 01: AWS Essentials
- [ ] Lab 02: Azure Fundamentals
- [ ] Lab 03: GCP Basics
- [ ] Lab 04: Serverless Computing
- [ ] Lab 05: Cost Optimization

## üéì Skills You'll Master
- **Multi-Cloud Architecture**: Design across AWS, Azure, GCP
- **Cloud-Native Services**: Managed databases, container services, ML platforms
- **Serverless Patterns**: Functions, API Gateway, Event-driven
- **Cost Management**: Reserved instances, spot instances, auto-scaling

- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch, Azure Monitor, Stackdriver
- **Automation**: CI/CD, IaC, GitOps

## üí∞ Cost Control
**IMPORTANT**: These labs use real cloud resources that incur costs:
- Always use free tier when available
- Set up billing alerts before starting
- Run cleanup scripts after each lab
- Use the provided cost calculators
- Lab 05 teaches how to reduce costs by 60%+
